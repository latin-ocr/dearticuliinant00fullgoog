De articulo ui pronomen relativum¹
adhibito.

l‘.F.Middletouus¹) censuit articulum Graecum semper pronomen
relativum esse, id quod ex eius ipsius verbis, quibus eum
describiti) intellegitur: „The Greek Propositive Article is the ¹
Pronoun Relative Ὁ, so ‘employed that its relation is supposed
to be more or less obscure; which. relation, therefore, is ex-
plained in some hdjunct annexed to the Artiole by the Parti·
ciple of Existence, expressed 01· understood. Hence the Article
ma'y be considered as the Snbject, and its Adjuuct as the
Praedicare, of a Proposition, differing froin ordinary Propositious

only as Assumptioo differs froin Asserlc'oc: for this is the only .

difference, between the Verb and the Participle‚ between ἐστὶν
aud dar et in nota praeterea scribit: „It might· by some be
expected, that Ι should rather have called the Article a Pronoun
Demonstrative3 since Pronouns Relatiwe are, according to
grammarians, those which have relation to persons or things
already mentioned, whilst those which are Denronstrative, now
for the first time point out the person or thing in question.
It will be shown, however, that the Article was originally used
,as a Pronoun Relative, in the usual acceptation oi that tenu,
and that subsequently, when it ceased to be so used, there was

still an implied reference to some object which had occupied ·

the mind oi the speaker, though perhaps not previously declared.'’
